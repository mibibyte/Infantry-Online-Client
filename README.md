# Infantry Online Client

This is the repository for the Free Infantry "Infantry Online Client". We aim to make it compatible with the original client functionality and playable on the latest operating systems. As with rest of Free Infantry, this is also an open source project. Your contribution is highly welcome.

The client that we currently use to play Infantry Online and Cosmic Rift with is the original, unchanged SOE Infantry v1.55 client.

## Technology and Tools

The client is written using **Visual Studio 2017** in C# and uses the SlimDX library for rendering (Direct3D 11) and the FMOD Audio Library.

We also use @gibbed (Rick's) Infantry Formats Library for parsing the file formats.

## Further Reading

1. See design.md for the technical details of how the client works.
2. See authors.md to know who to contact about particular things
